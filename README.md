# What is the Cyberfox ?

* Cyberfox is a powerful and handy web browser that resembles the popular Mozilla Firefox quite a lot as it uses Mozillaâ€™s source code. Itâ€™s an
open source browser that uses its own installation profile, which means that you do not need to uninstall Firefox to install and use this browser
on the same computer as well. Furthermore, Cyberfox removes all the features from Firefox that collected and sent information about your 
browsing habits and data to third parties. This doesnâ€™t only make it more secure and more suitable for the protection of your privacy, but it also 
makes it faster, more lightweight, more stable and more reliable.


* Anyway, Cyberfox kept all the handy features and functions that made Firefox the popular web browser that everybody acclaims. 
Therefore, itâ€™s fast, reliable, easy-to-use, and it comes packed with a lot of cool options and built-in tools.
Everything you like about Firefox is also available within Cyberfox, too: the tabbed interface, the download manager, 
the extensions, the developer tools, etc.

* Cyberfox is a Mozilla-based Internet browser designed to take advantage of 64-bit architecture but a 32-bit version is also available. The application provides a higher memory performance when navigating your favorite pages.

> In conclusion, Cyberfox represents a nice choice if youâ€™re interested in trying a new browser. Itâ€™s rather obscure compared to the popular browser, but this doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s less valuable.
